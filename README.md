# Land-mark-detection-CNN
Facial landmark detection using Convolutional Neural Network with python 


If you want to create a program to recognize and detect facial landmarks using Python, you can use this project

To create this program, the first thing you have to do is collect data, so you can use these two methods: 
* **Use of pre-prepared datasets**
* **Create your own dataset**
in this project we must use our own dataset so i made my own dataset which i will teach you to do it
